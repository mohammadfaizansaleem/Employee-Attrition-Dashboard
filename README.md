# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard
Here's my first interactive dashboard here, made on Microsoft Power BI Desktop, but before jumping to the visualization part, we cleaned data using Power Query Editor.

Here are the steps I took to clean our data:

◾Removed unnecessary columns  
◾Cleaned some columns by splitting using a delimiter, replacing values, and changing data types  
◾Added new custom columns

Throughout this project, I was able to apply my knowledge and skills of:

◾Dataanalysis  
◾Data Interpretation  
◾Data Cleaning  
◾Graphs and Charts  
◾Data Visualization  
◾Analysis and Insights  
During this project, first I used Power Query Editor to do Data Manipulation and clean up required for the data visualization and then Power BI Visualization tool to create an impactful and visually appealing report  
  Scope of the project:  
◾ Reasons behind attrition
◾ KPIs supporting the story

Project lessons:  
Identified key factors of attribution  
◾ In terms of the education field, most attribution was from Life Science followed by Medical and Marketing.  
◾ The top 4 job roles in terms of attrition are Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Sales Representative, and Human Resources.  
◾ Most of the employees left the organization after their first year.   
◾ The people that left the organization had compensation of less than 5000.  
◾ Employees of the age bracket 26-35 Yrs are the ones that left the organization.   

Recommendations:  
◾ The first thing we should revise is the compensation according to the industry standards that will solve most of the issues, like younger employees leaving the organization, and employees leaving the organization after completing their first year.  
◾ We should focus on the top 4 job roles leaving the organization and/or departments and work on the possibilities to increase the average satisfaction, which is currently around half.
